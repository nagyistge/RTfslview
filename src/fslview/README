# FIXME
1. Each layer processing application.cpp @ 1160 `bool ApplicationWindow::loadOverlay(const QString & absFilePath,QString lookuptable)`
2. Each data file is headered in 'storage/image.h'
3. Each file named 'nii.gz' http://nifti.nimh.nih.gov/nifti-1
4. 'nii.gz' quote "NIFTI1 can store data with different meanings. Imaging data, statistical values and other data (any vector, matrix, label set or mesh). can be saved in a nifti1 *.nii or *.hdr/*.img file. Once a data intent is chosen, the use of the nifti1 format is unambigious since the use of particular fields for a certain intent is predetermined. "
5. Each data file at least have timeseries of (x,y,z) and volumn attributes.
